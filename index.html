    <p>The following chart shows the change in Scotblood's blood stock over time. Note that a higher number of days remaining does not mean that there is more stock in real terms, only that it is estimated to last longer.</p>
    <p>This project aims to see if there are any visible trends in stock levels e.g. more or less in different seasons or after major events.</p>
